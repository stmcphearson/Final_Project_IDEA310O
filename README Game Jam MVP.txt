Accomplishments:

- Obstacle movement
- Character controller movement
- Deathzones, rudimentary player death handling
- Non-deadly and deadly obstacles
- Completion of one level


Remaining Tasks:

- UI for death screen and win screen
- UI for menu screen
- Character select and level select screens
- Create more levels
- Player character manipulation (rotation + split)
- Obstacle staggered timings script
- Improve decoration/style of obstacles and player, maybe add 
background/environmental elements


Challenges:

- I tried setting up timing delays for obstacles using coroutines but I 
couldn't get it to work, help with this would be appreciated.
- Player character manipulation I am unsure how to approach, I may need 
help here too.
- I have no idea how to create menus or UIs, some tutorials/guides 
for doing this would be very helpful.


List of Potential Expanding Ideas (ignore the scope creep, this is for 
my own future reference in case I want to build out the game further):

- add pickups that modify speed/size
- add sections with enemies + weapon pickups
- add longer levels with checkpoints
- add music and sound effects
- add smoothing animations, gameplay animations, death animations, etc
- add camera mobility/changed POV for enemy sections
